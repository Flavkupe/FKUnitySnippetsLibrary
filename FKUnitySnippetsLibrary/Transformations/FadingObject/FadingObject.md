### FadingObject
A commonly used script for making things disappear slowly. Used this for text that should fade out after some time, or for enemies that died, to make them disappear more smoothly.

There is an option for destroying the object after fading out, to make it easier to destroy objects that have fully faded. However, note that if you use this you will not be able to fade them back in.
