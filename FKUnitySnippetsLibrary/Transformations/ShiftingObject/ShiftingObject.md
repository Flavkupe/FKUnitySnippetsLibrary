### ShiftingObject
It's just an object that floats straight up. Or sideways, or some other direction. But in a 2D game, it'll usually be up. This is a simple script but I have found it to be extremely common to need this for all sorts of stuff.

It's particularly useful for text, and when mixed with the FadingObject script to make the text fade as it floats up.
