### Spinning Object
This extremely simple script seems trivial, but it can be used creatively in many ways. See the various demos to see how you can:

1. Make an object spin at variable speeds.
2. Spin various objects around an object.
3. Spin a 2D object around the Y axis to have a "spinning coin" effect common in 2D platformers.
